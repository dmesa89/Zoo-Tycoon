# Zoo-Tycoon
I am designing a program that simulates the game Zoo Tycoon. The user will be in
charge of multiple animal classes and be prompted with tasks such as purchasing animals,
feeding, and collecting profits. Random events will happen throughout the program such as,
profits for attendance boom, animal sickness, and births of baby animals. At the end of each
day the user will be prompted to continue playing or end the game.
